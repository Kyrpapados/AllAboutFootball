# AllAboutFootball

This app is not for commercial use.

It demonstrates just the way of thinking of its creator.

The purpose of the project is the use of

=> MVP

=> Dagger 2.XX

=> Retrofit 2

=> RxJava 2

with powerful Kotlin.

I will try to continuously update the project.

You can find all the api call here
